            It follows the lives of three engineering students—Rancho, Farhan,
            and Raju—navigating a rigid, pressure-filled education system.
            Rancho, played by Aamir Khan, stands out as a free spirit who
            challenges conventional learning, inspiring his friends to follow
            their passions instead of societal expectations. The film alternates
            between their college years and a present-day search for Rancho, who
            disappeared after graduation. Through humor and heart, 3 Idiots
            critiques the academic pressure students face and explores themes of
            friendship, mental health, and the importance of pursuing personal
            fulfillment over societal definitions of success.<br />
            With its mix of comedy and deep emotional moments, the film delivers
            a timeless message: follow your passion, think outside the box, and
            value learning over rote memorization.

            A gripping tale of an oppressed village's fight for survival, where
            a cricket match against British rulers becomes a symbol of hope and
            defiance.

            Lagaan is set in late 19th-century colonial India, where a small
            village faces crippling taxes (lagaan) imposed by British rulers.
            When the villagers plead for relief, the arrogant British officer,
            Captain Russell, challenges them to a cricket match—an unfamiliar
            sport to the locals. If they win, their taxes will be canceled for
            three years, but if they lose, the burden will be tripled. Led by
            the spirited and courageous Bhuvan, the villagers, despite their
            lack of knowledge of the game, form a team and train
            relentlessly.<br />
            Overcoming personal differences, cultural barriers, and limited
            resources, they prepare for a showdown that will determine their
            future. Lagaan is a powerful story of resilience, unity, and the
            indomitable spirit of ordinary people rising against colonial
            oppression. The film combines drama, sportsmanship, and patriotism,
            culminating in a thrilling, emotionally charged final match that
            echoes the villagers’ fight for dignity and survival.

            Schindler's List is a deeply moving historical drama set during
            World War II, following the true story of Oskar Schindler, a German
            businessman who profits from the war by employing Jewish workers in
            his factories. Initially driven by personal gain, Schindler
            gradually becomes aware of the horrors of the Holocaust and the fate
            of the Jewish community under Nazi rule. As the atrocities
            intensify, Schindler’s moral compass shifts, leading him to make
            life-altering decisions that impact the lives of those around
            him.<br />
            The film paints a harrowing picture of the brutality and inhumanity
            of the Holocaust while highlighting themes of courage, sacrifice,
            and redemption. Directed by Steven Spielberg, Schindler's List is a
            poignant exploration of the human capacity for good in the face of
            overwhelming evil, offering a powerful tribute to the resilience and
            spirit of those who suffered during one of history's darkest
            periods.

            A riveting psychological thriller that follows an FBI trainee's

            The Silence of the Lambs is a chilling psychological thriller that
            follows Clarice Starling, a young FBI trainee tasked with
            interviewing Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a brilliant but imprisoned
            cannibalistic psychiatrist, to gain insights into the mind of a
            serial killer known as Buffalo Bill. As Clarice delves deeper into
            the investigation, she must navigate the complex and manipulative
            relationship with Lecter, who offers cryptic clues while probing
            into her past and fears.<br />
            The film explores themes of power, control, and the nature of evil,
            as Clarice races against time to prevent further murders. With its
            haunting atmosphere and unforgettable performances, particularly by
            Anthony Hopkins as Lecter, The Silence of the Lambs masterfully
            blends elements of horror and suspense, creating a tense narrative
            that leaves a lasting impact on its audience. Directed by Jonathan
            Demme, this iconic film remains a landmark in the thriller genre.

            Titanic is a sweeping romantic drama that follows the ill-fated
            maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic in 1912. The film centers on Jack
            Dawson, a penniless artist, and Rose DeWitt Bukater, a young woman
            from a wealthy family, who meet aboard the luxurious ship. Despite
            their different social backgrounds, they form a deep and passionate
            bond that challenges societal norms and expectations. As their love
            blossoms, Rose grapples with her impending arranged marriage and the
            constraints of her upper-class life.<br />
            The film beautifully captures the opulence of the Titanic and the
            emotional struggles of its characters, all while highlighting themes
            of love, sacrifice, and resilience. As the voyage takes a disastrous
            turn, Jack and Rose must navigate the chaos around them, fighting to
            survive against overwhelming odds. Directed by James Cameron,
            Titanic is a poignant tribute to love enduring in the face of
            tragedy, leaving a lasting impact on audiences worldwide.
